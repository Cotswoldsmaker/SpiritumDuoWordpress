#25/01/2022 - Preparing for a stakeholders meeting

####By: Mark Bailey

We are currently working towards a stakeholders meeting for mid-February.  We are collaborating with the Innovation Lab at NHSx (soon to be NHSE) on creating a proof-of-concept clinical app for the lung cancer pathway. It is very exciting to see how the app is progressing with Nick and Joe's input, and we hope to have a good quality app with some basically functionality to be able to showcase at the meeting in mid-Feb. I will keep you all updated.
