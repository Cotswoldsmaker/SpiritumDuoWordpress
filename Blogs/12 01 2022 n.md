#12/01/2022 - I just discovered 'Git It Write'

#####By: Mark Bailey

So I have been thinking for a while how best to create web material. I recently read on Twitter that you can use git to keep a record of your material. So I did a bit of research and came across the Wordpress plugin 'Git It Write' by <u><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/Vaakash/">vaakash</a></u>. This is a great little plugin that lets you create markdown in a Github repository, and for it to link up to your Wordpress server automatically when ever you update the repo. Webhooks help with the latter. I am still discovering how to use this tool, but I think it is the way to go with this website so that we can keep tract of changes.
