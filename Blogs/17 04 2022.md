#17/04/2022 - Loading animation for Spiritum Duo

####By: Mark Bailey

So I don't get much time at the moment to actually code, as I am navigating the politics around creating a new digital pathway within my trust. So I was very pleased this weekend when I was able to sit down, learn about animated SVGs and actually create one. It takes the Spiritum Duo icon (a dandilion) and the seeds disappear and reappear. I will upload a working copy of th animated AVG shortly. Click the icon below to see it working (Wordpress will not play it natually on this page):
